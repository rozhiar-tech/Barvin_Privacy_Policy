3. Data Sharing & Disclosure

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. We may share your information with:

	•	Legal Authorities: If required by law or to protect our rights.

4. Third-Party Services
	•	OpenStreetMap Tiles: We display map tiles fetched from https://tile.openstreetmap.org/.... Your device contacts OSM directly when you view the map.
	•	Image Uploads & Hosting: Avatar images and item images are uploaded to and served from our backend API (http://95.111.224.58:4000/api).

5. Security

We employ industry-standard measures to protect your data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. Passwords are hashed server-side before storage. However, no system is 100% secure—please keep your credentials confidential.
